# 📊 Linear Regression on Students' Social Media Addiction

This project explores the relationship between students' social media usage and various behavioral and academic outcomes using linear regression. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook with Python and key libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `linearregression.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all data analysis, visualization, and model training steps.
- `Students Social Media Addiction.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing survey responses from students about their social media usage and related variables.

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset  
- Visualize correlations and trends between social media usage and factors like sleep, academic performance, etc.  
- Build a linear regression model to analyze predictive relationships  
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and interpret the results

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Linear Regression Model Fitting  
- Visualization of regression lines and residuals  
- Model evaluation using R² score and error metrics


## 📈 Example Output

- Regression plots showing the influence of social media usage on sleep or grades  
- R² and MSE scores to assess model performance

## 📂 Dataset Info

The dataset includes features such as:
- Hours spent on social media  
- Academic performance indicators
